Sir.Venus, a native of the planet Londaynon, part of the Faynomen dynasty, is characterized by some innate factors.
Sir.Venus already at birth did not represent the classic child. It often happened that he disappeared for days and then returned. 
When he reappeared, he confessed that he had always been among them but they could not hear him. 
The population began to believe him crazy so much so he was immediately isolated. 
Growing up Sir.Venus began to understand that she had powers and began to practice. Slowly he realized that he had the gift of invisibility. 
This gift from him represents a fundamental element in winning many battles. So much so that Sir.Venus went from being considered a madman to a hero. 
On the death of King Finodom, they do not consider themselves the classic dynasty but Sir.venus himself was gored. 
The latter managed to guarantee peace and serenity to the planet Faynomen.
