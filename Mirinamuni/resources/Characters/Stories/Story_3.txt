Sir Soley, a native of the planet Sunblood, part of the Soleyman dynasty was selected as a military leader in several expeditions. 
We remember his victories in the battles of Brandy, Wormy and the famous fight, without winners and losers of Menney that lasted 20 years.
Sir Soley from an early age has distinguished himself for his innumerable intellectual and military gifts.
Famous for his great cunning he managed to expand his tomorrows not only through struggles and dominations but through negotiations that allowed him to keep a large part of his army alive. Sir. Soley had an army of 700,000 men.
Legend has it that Sir. Soley, finding himself in difficulty in the battle of the Brandy, had performed acts of devotion such as walking barefoot on the blazing fire and for long distances, moreover he would withdraw for hours and hours to pray to the God of the Sun to allow him to win the battle.
It is said that during the battle, Sir Soley, pierced by a sword, was not dead. Instead of his blood, a yellow liquid began to gush out and formed his massive armor. Since then Sir. Soley managed to devastate entire populations even alone.
His goal was to expand his dominion to any planet.
