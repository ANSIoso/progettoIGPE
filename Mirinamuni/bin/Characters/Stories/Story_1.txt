Legend has it that Sir.Acquator, as a child, was very devoted to his king and to his homeland so much so that he did everything to become the king's right shoulder. Grueling workouts, intense study to achieve your goals. 
Then a particular event happened. The planet Nymame was invaded by the Ostrogens, a people coming from the Bundinamy. 
Sir.Acquator fought with all his strength but this was not enough. Exhausted, no longer knowing how to help his homeland, he went to the Genseman River, known for his countless miracles but also for his curses. 
Sir.Acquator prayed that his people would not be massacred and would do anything to keep it from happening.
Legend has it that in battle, despite having been pierced by a sword, he did not die, on the contrary his body began to become liquid pir maintaining human features. 
Sir.Acquator managed to save his homeland but from that moment on he never returned as before depriving himself of all the pleasure that the human body could give.
